<h2> My Personal Life, Goals, and Interests</h2>
<p>
    My name is Josiah Nelson.  I am a student at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire, with my major being currently business undecided.  My goal is to pursue a job that fufills my basic needs and some of the wants that I desire.  If I decide to have a family in the future, the previous would apply for them too.  Apart from my academic pursuit, I enjoy many things.  I enjoy going to the gym, golfing, longboarding, occasionally going skiing in the winter, and playing video games on Xbox and PC. On Xbox, I enjoy playing Halo, Call of Duty, Apex Legends, Minecraft, and Overwatch.  Since I currently do not have a high quality gaming PC, my options are limited, but I enjoy playing Minecraft, 7 days to die, Geometry Dash, some Roblox games, OSU!, and Chess on my laptop.</p>
    <h2>My Work Experience and History</h2>
    <p>In terms of work, I have worked at three places so far.  I have worked at a golf course, an indoor advernture/trampoline park, and a distribution center.  At the golf course, I drove the cart that picked up all the balls on the driving range.  I was an ordinary team member at the adventure/trampoline park.  Currently, I work at a distribution center, where I assist in many ways in getting product processed so it can be sent to stores.  I work at the Menards distribution center, so I deal with lots of outdoor and home improvement products, such as power tools, light fixtures, and a lot of other products people use for projects and/or improving their home.  In the future, I hope to get an internship based on the major that I choose to pursue, and after that, a full-time job based on the major.</p>
    <h2>My Academic Achievements</h2>
    <p>I was born in San Jose, California, but I have lived and went to school in the Madison area since preschool.  I went to Middleton High School, which is just outside of Madison.  While I was there, I acquired some academic achivements over there.  I managed to achieve the honor roll (min 3.6 GPA)  for 7 out of 8 semesters, which allowed me to graduate with honors.  I was also an officer for DECA, which is a business club.  I helped with community service stuff.  I have not made nearly as many academic achievements at Eau Claire, because I am only a sophomore.  So far, my best academic achievement was making the deans list in the fall 2022 semester.  I hope to make it at least one more time, as well as potentially achieving something else at Eau Claire.</p>
