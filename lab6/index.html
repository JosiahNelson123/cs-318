         <p>Over the last 20+ years, The Halo franchise has produced over 15 different games throughout the years.  Despite having all of these games, I have only played around half of them.  Even though I have not played all of the games in the franchise, I still consider Halo to be the best game that I have ever played. The ones that I have played are the ones that are more popular and mainstream throughout the Hako community.  The other games in the franchise are still good, but have been played less because they are usually only played by people that are extreme Halo junkies.</p>

         <h2>My Personal Opinion On The Best Halo games that I Have Played</h2>
         <ol>
             <li>Halo 2 (2004)</li>
             <li>Halo 3 (2007)</li>
             <li>Halo: Combat Evolved (2001)</li>
             <li>Halo Infinite (2021)</li>
             <li>Halo Reach (2010)</li>
             <li>Halo 5 (2015)</li>
             <li>Halo 4 (2012)</li>
             <li>Halo: Fireteam Raven (2018) (This game is only found at arcades)</li>
             <li>Halo 3: ODST (2009)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For most of the games, I have only played the campaign, which is the story mode of Halo, where you play by yourself and try to beat a variety missions that are all connected to a story line.  The other mode is online multiplayer, which has different modes, such as team death match, free for all, and capture the flag.  I have only played online multiplayer for Halo 5 and Infinite, because they were both on the newest Xbox.  I never had an online account for the other games, so I never got the nostalgic multiplayer experience, which I regret.  However, I have played split screen with the ones that I never played online multiplayer with, which is where you can play with 1-3 other people on the same device.</p>
        <p>There is the main storyline, which consists of Halo CE,2, 3, 4, 5, and Halo Infinite.  These all feature the Spartan (a supersoldier) called the Master Cheif, who is the main character throughout the franchise.  These Halos are in chronological order, and these are the ones that I have played and enjoyed the most.  The other Halos take place during different times throughout the main storyline, but are about different people and feature different events.</p>
